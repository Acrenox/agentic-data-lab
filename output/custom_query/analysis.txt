Query: For each driver, calculate their maximum points in any race (as max_points_per_race), their career total points (as career_points), and their total number of podiums (finishing 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, as total_podiums). Output driver name, surname, and these three columns, sorted by career_points descending. Do not include year or race breakdown.

ANALYSIS REPORT
================================================================================

The data provides a summary of Formula 1 drivers' performance, encompassing their best single-race point score (`max_points_per_race`), total career points (`career_points`), and number of podium finishes (`total_podiums`).  The descriptive statistics reveal a highly skewed distribution across all three metrics.  The large standard deviations for `career_points` and `total_podiums` compared to their means suggest that a small number of drivers have accumulated significantly more points and podiums than the vast majority.  This indicates a considerable performance disparity within the driver population, with a few elite performers dominating the sport historically.

The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for `career_points` and `total_podiums` being relatively low (0.0, 0.0, and 8.14/1.0 respectively) further emphasize the concentration of success. Many drivers likely had short or less successful careers, accumulating few points and podiums. The wide range in `max_points_per_race` (0 to 50) is probably due to changes in the points systems across Formula 1 seasons, as well as potentially a few one-off excellent performances by otherwise less successful drivers. To fully understand the trends, we should look at the career lengths and year of first and last race for these drivers.
